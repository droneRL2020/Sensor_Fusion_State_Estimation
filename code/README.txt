Implemented UKF for extra credit. Please check file ukf.m.

To activate UKF, please open `ekf2.m` and set `USE_UKF = 1`.

On my local machine, UKF performed better than EKF and no-filtering on dataset 1 and 9. UKF performed worse than no-filtering on dataset 4.

On the auto-grader, EKF performed better than UKF.
